#Create a program that takes two numbers as input and prints whether the first number is greater than,
# less than, or equal to the second number.

a=int(input("Enter first number"))
b=int(input("Enter second number"))

print("first number is greater than second number", a>b)
print("first number is less than second number", a<b)
print("first number is equal to second number", a==b)
